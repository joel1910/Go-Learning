ðŸŒŸ What is Go (Golang)?

Go, also called Golang, is an open-source programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

Itâ€™s designed to be:

Simple (easy to learn, clean syntax)

Fast (compiled to machine code, runs close to C speed)

Concurrent (built-in support for concurrency using goroutines and channels)

Reliable (strong typing, memory safety, garbage collection)

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

Compiled Language â†’ Produces fast executables like C/C++.

Concurrency Support â†’ Uses goroutines and channels for lightweight multithreading.

Static Typing â†’ Type safety at compile-time, but with some flexibility.

Garbage Collected â†’ No need to manually free memory.

Cross-platform â†’ Can build for Linux, Windows, macOS from one machine.

Rich Standard Library â†’ Networking, web servers, crypto, JSON, etc.

Fast Compilation â†’ Much faster than Java/C++.
